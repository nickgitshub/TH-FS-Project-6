Changed all the background colors for the sidebar to a dark blue #393782 in style.css file. Also changed the default backgrounds in the foundation.css file to #393782.

I changed the color of .portfolio-me anchor tag to the color: white to make it more visible.

I changed my h1 title font to a more bold version of Merriweather with Merriwather Sans. Add the link in the layout.pug file.

Added .25em padding, a border of .25em, and border-style of double to the portfolio index thumbnails to the style.css file.

Gave all .thumbnail and .image elements a border-radius of 10px.
